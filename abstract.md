Mitril - A React-like user interface micro-library
==================================================

Imagine writing custom tags without jumping into a morass of JavaScript
and framework dependencies. Mithril's small API (and learning curve),
safe-by-default templates and neck-snapping performance are a step up
from bulky, opinionated frameworks.

Mithril makes application code discoverable, readable and maintainable.
It's tiny at 7.8 KB (yes, 7.8 KB) with no dependencies. And yet Mithril
goes toe-to-toe with the big boys including advanced capabilities like
transclusion, computed properties and nested custom tags. And it's fast.
Benchmarks show it to be faster than React or Angular 2.0.

If you're an Angular or React programmer you really owe it to yourself
to check out Mithril. You'll understand it entirely in an hour and
wonder why you didn't discover it sooner.
